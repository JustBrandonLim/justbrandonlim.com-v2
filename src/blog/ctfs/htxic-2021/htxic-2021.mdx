I participated in HTX Investigators' Challenge 2021 with my team CGArmy and managed to clinch the 27th placing out
of 118 teams. I am proud of my team as it is a decent placing, considering that my team and I had
little to no experience with CTFs.

Overall, it was a great experience for me because I got to put my skills to the test, as well as
showcase my abilites by solving various challenges.
