After many hours of work, I finally published my new website that was written with **GatsbyJS** and **TailwindCSS**.

Ever since I started programming at the age of 12, I had never been good with colours and designs.
However, I tried my best to learn as much as I could.
This website was made to be as simple and clean as possible.

Trying to follow the best practices while coding this site, I am proud to finally say that I am satisfied.

That's all for today folks.

Below is a snippet of **Hello World** written in **C++** as the blog title states.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    cout << "Hello World!" << endl;
}
```
