Back when I was taking driving lessons at Bukit Batok Driving Centre (BBDC), I was unable to book my
practical lessons because it was mostly fully booked! I managed to come up with a solution, by making a bot that
"snipes" for lessons that people sell at the last minute.

### About FastDrivingPractical

FastDrivingPractical is a tool that allows you to book your Class 3/3A practical lessons easily
without needing to camp for slots manually.

### How it's done

For simplicity sake, I decided to use C# with WinForms to code this program.

Initially, I used Selenium to login and check the slots periodically, however, it was a very impractical
and slow solution. To come up with a solution, I reversed the API endpoints of BBDC in order to use
HTTP requests instead of Selenium as it is much faster, with no rendering.

Eventually, I managed to hook up my program with Discord's API so that I am able to send notifications
when a slot was successfully sniped.
