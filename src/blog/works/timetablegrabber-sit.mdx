Back when I was in Ngee Ann Polytechnic pursuing my Diploma in Information Technology,
the school's website allowed us to export our timetables to our phone's calendar conveniently.
This meant that we would not need to login every week to check our timetable, saving valuable
time in the long run.

### About TimetableGrabber - SIT

TimetableGrabber - SIT is a tool that allows you to grab and export your trimester's timetable
to the .ics format where you can import it to your favourite calendar.

### How it's done

For simplicity sake, I decided to use C# with XAML to code this program.

At first, I thought of using HTTP requests to scrape the timetable data, since it is fast because
there is no rendering of the web pages. However, when trying out my proposed solution, my program did
not work as I expected. Upon further debugging, I soon realized that IN4SIT is mostly built with
iframes and JavaScript which meant that using pure HTTP requests would not work properly
for this project.

However, there was another solution to this problem. I decided to use Selenium with Html Agility Pack
since it was automated and I was able to hide the browser with headless Chrome.

```csharp
ChromeDriverService chromeDriverService = ChromeDriverService.CreateDefaultService();
chromeDriverService.HideCommandPromptWindow = true;

ChromeOptions chromeOptions = new ChromeOptions();
chromeOptions.AddArgument("headless");
chromeOptions.AddArgument("--window-size=1920,1080");
chromeOptions.AddArgument("--disable-extensions");

webDriverInstance = new ChromeDriver(chromeDriverService, chromeOptions);
webDriverInstance.Manage().Window.Maximize();
```

There were a few more hiccups along the way, such as IN4SIT generating dynamic CSS, which meant that I
had to use XPath instead of CssSelector.

Once I was able to login and reach the timetable's page, I had to scrape the data. I used
Html Agility Pack to achieve this.

```csharp
HtmlDocument htmlDocument = new HtmlDocument();
htmlDocument.LoadHtml(webDriverInstance.PageSource);
```

After scraping the data, I then used a library called ical.NET to export
the data into the .ics format which can be imported to almost any calendar.

```csharp
Calendar exportCalendar = new Calendar();

foreach (Course course in timetable)
{
    CalendarEvent calendarEvent = new CalendarEvent
    {
        Summary = string.Format("{0} - {1} - {2}", course.Name, course.Section, course.Component),
        Start = new CalDateTime(course.StartDateTime),
        End = new CalDateTime(course.EndDateTime),
        Location = course.Location
    };

    exportCalendar.Events.Add(calendarEvent);
}

CalendarSerializer calendarSerializer = new CalendarSerializer();
string serializedCalendar = calendarSerializer.SerializeToString(exportCalendar);
```

Viola! The program was working after a day of hard work!
